Usage:
* In this project i Used GameMaker for the engine 
* GameMaker marketplace & itch.io for the sprites
* and for the sound effects i used the open source website https://www.myinstants.com/

Also this 2D game is similar to many games outhere that the concept behind it is running and jumping and surviving from the enemies


Technical detail:
- Dealing with shaders and a new game developer was hard at first then i figured out by reading the documentation and watches tuturiols of how the concept works also gives me an idea of how it should go
